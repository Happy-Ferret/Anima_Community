###Early Draft

Welcome to Anima OS!

One of the goals of the Anima project is the creation of a stable, friendly and open minded community
of people from all walks of life. 

As such, every member of the community is tasked to act in the most considerate way, which includes adhering
to the following golden rule. 

```No person should, under any circumstance, be discriminated against on the basis of gender, gender identity,
sexuality, race, ethnicity or cultural upbringing```

Any violation of this rule should be immediately reported to the administrative staff, where the claims will 
be investigated independently and free from bias.
